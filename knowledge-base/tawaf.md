# Tawaf (Circumambulation) – Authentic Steps

## 1. Preparation
- Be in a state of wudu (recommended).
- Ensure you are in Ihram if required by your type of Hajj/Umrah.
- Approach al-Masjid al-Haram with the right foot and recite the dua of entering.

## 2. Starting Tawaf
- Begin at the Black Stone (al-Hajar al-Aswad).
- Face it, raise your hand, and say “Allahu Akbar.”

## 3. Number of Circuits
- Tawaf is 7 complete rounds around the Ka'bah.
- Move counter-clockwise with the Ka'bah on your left.

## 4. Duas
- No fixed dua is required.
- You may recite Qur’an, dhikr, or personal supplications.

## 5. Raml (Men Only)
- First 3 rounds: brisk walk (raml) for men if the area permits.

## 6. Between Yemeni Corner and Black Stone
- Sunnah to say: “Rabbana atina fi al-dunya hasanah wa fi al-akhirati hasanah wa qina ‘adhab an-nar.”

## 7. Completion
- After the 7th round, pray two rak’ahs behind Maqam Ibrahim if possible.
